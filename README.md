# Job-Applications-Prediction-using-Web-Scraping-and-ML

This project was done as a part of the Online Paradox Hackathon organized by IIT Madras in December 2022. The team consisted of 5 members and each of us had our own roles. We basically used Selenium to scrape automate searches and scrape a popular job finding portal. Once we obtained the csv filed, we cleaned it and removed all null values. The Data was then tested over different Machine learning models.
